# Overview

This repository contains test scenarios developed for an e-commerce client as part of an internship at Quality Island.
The web application under test allows end-users to create, configure, and sell courses, digital products, and other services.

Each intern was responsible for designing multiple positive test scenarios for their assigned module.  
These scenarios served as a comprehensive resource to help the client's beta testers efficiently execute and track their testing efforts.

Each test scenario includes the following elements:
* Test name
* Test steps
* Expected results
* Prerequisites
* Comments (to be completed during test execution)
* Status (to be updated during test execution)

# My Contribution

I was responsible for the **"Quizzes"** (within the "Courses" module), which allows users to customize courses by creating tests/quizzes, adding graphics and attachments.
It also enables users to duplicate existing tests/quizzes, modify their components (e.g. rearrange answers within a test), track student progress (answers made, passed/failed tests), and delete tests/quizzes entirely.

The scenarios I created cover:
* Creating a new test
* Adding questions and answers within the test
* Copying a test
* Copying a test to another course
* Reordering tests, questions, and answers
* Editing test details via the "Basic Information" page (name, description, etc.)
* Editing the test's URL via the "Basic Information" page
* Adding a thumbnail image via the "Basic Information" page
* Attaching files to the test
* Tracking student's progress (test results)
* Deleting a test

> Note: All test cases created during the internship are positive scenarios only; negative tests were out of scope.


# ! Important Notice !
The purpose of the repository is to showcase my individual contributions to the client's project during my internship at Quality Island.

All sensitive data (such as URLs and the client's name) has been anonymized to ensure data privacy and security.
